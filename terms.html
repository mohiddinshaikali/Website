    <p>I am Dayal Khanti Chakma, currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) at National College. I am deeply interested in web development and am currently working on a project where I am utilizing HTML and CSS to create an interactive and visually appealing website. This project allows me to apply my skills in coding and design, and Iâ€™m focused on enhancing my understanding of front-end development. Through this project, I aim to develop a strong foundation in building responsive and user-friendly websites while also exploring the creative aspects of web design. My journey in web development is a great opportunity for me to grow and contribute to the digital world.</p>
